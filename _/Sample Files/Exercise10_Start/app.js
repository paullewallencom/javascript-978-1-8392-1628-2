/*For a possible game, set up the creation of an object that uses a prototype.  Use Object.create(), a constructor function, or a class, to create a game character object. Set up the prototype to have the following properties:
-speed (default value: 6)
-stregnth (default value: 8)
-hitpoints (default value 150)
-a method that determines damage per second and returns it. That is equal to speed * stregnth
Create one object providing values for speed and hitpoints. Let stregnth use default value. Then display damage per second*/
